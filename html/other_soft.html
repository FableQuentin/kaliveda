Other optional software packages which may add more functionality to KaliVeda if installed before building include:
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>GEMINI++</dt>
If this nuclear statistical decay code is installed, we provide a simple interface to it, as well as the possibility
to use it as an afterburner before filtering simulated data for detector efficiency. Instructions for downloading
and installing as needed can be found <a href="https://github.com/kaliveda-dev/kaliveda/wiki/Using-Gemini-in-KaliVeda">here</a>.
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>Google Protocol buffers</dt>
Raw FAZIA data is written using <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">Google protocol buffers</a>.
Installation of the software for reading the buffers is mandatory if you want to read raw FAZIA data.

<dl>
<dt>MultiFrame Metaformat (MFM) data</dt>
The latest GANIL/SPIRAL2 acquisition data format can be read by KaliVeda if you first build and install the package
which can be found <a href="https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/jdfcode/mfmlib">here</a>.
