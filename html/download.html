<h1>Getting the sources</h1>

<p>
KaliVeda is available to download and build from source from our 
<a href="https://github.com/kaliveda-dev/kaliveda">Github repository</a>.
If you want to know more about <tt>git</tt>, here is a good <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">book</a> you can read (for free).
The <tt>git</tt> reference guide is <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs">here</a>.

<dt>First time setup</dt>
The first time you download the source code, you need to <i>clone</i> the repository by typing the following command
(note that the <tt>'$'</tt> at the beginning of the line represents the shell prompt, which may be different on
your machine):

<div class="code">$ git clone https://github.com/kaliveda-dev/kaliveda.git
</div>


This will create a directory called 'kaliveda' containing the source code. By default, the version of KaliVeda
in this directory will be 1.10. Different versions are stored in the repository as different <i>branches</i>:

<div class="code">$ cd kaliveda
$ git branch -vv
* <font color="green">1.10</font> b3429a41 [<font color="blue">origin/1.10</font>] Same as previous commit  for Si2-CsI identification...
</div>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>Changing/choosing the version/branch</dt>

There are two main branches of KaliVeda to choose from, depending on your needs. This table gives the branch names
and corresponding version numbers:

<table>
<tr>
   <th>Branch</th>
   <th>Version</th>
   <th>Comments</th>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>1.10</td>
   <td>1.10/17</td>
   <td><i>Old (stable) version, required for INDRA-VAMOS analysis</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>master</td>
   <td>1.11/01</td>
   <td><i>Development version, required for INDRAFAZIA analysis</i></td>
</tr>
</table>

To change the version of the KaliVeda source code in your copy you need to change working directory
to the directory where you cloned the repository and use the <tt>git checkout</tt> command:

<div class="code">$ cd kaliveda
$ git checkout master
Branch 'master' set up to track remote branch 'master' from 'origin'.
Switched to a new branch 'master'

$ git branch -vv
  1.10   b3429a41 [origin/1.10] Same as previous commit  for Si2-CsI identification...
* <font color="green">master</font> 379a3779 [<font color="blue">origin/master</font>] Adding missing CsI calib params for FAZIACOR
</div>

You can change from one branch to another at any time using the same command and the name of the branch you want.

<dt>Updating your copy of the sources</dt>
To keep up to date with ongoing development, you may need to update your sources from the server from time
to time. To do this, change working directory to the directory where you cloned the repository, make sure
you are on the right branch (see above), and then use the <tt>git pull</tt> command:
<div class="code">$ cd kaliveda
$ git pull
