# How to build and install the KaliVeda toolkit

## 0. Prerequisites
### ROOT
Works with any version of ROOT 5.xx, we recommend the latest 5.34 version
Works with ROOT6, at least with 6.20 (we recommend the latest version of 6.20)

### CMake
At least version 2.8.11 of cmake is required.

## 1. Build & Install

In the following, S is the path (full or relative) to the source directory, B is the out-of-source build directory, and I is the full path to the directory where the toolkit will be installed after building.

Create the build directory and run cmake to configure the build. The simplest build (only basic libraries - see below for build options) looks like:

    $ mkdir B
    $ cd B
    $ cmake S -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=I

Then to build and install the toolkit:

    $ make [-jN]
    $ make install
    
(if you have a N-processor machine, you can do 'make -jN' in order to speed up the build with a parallel make). In order to use the toolkit, it may be necessary to add I/bin to your PATH variable, and I/lib to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable, if executables and libraries in these two locations are not already automatically found on your system.

### 1.1 Build options

By default, only the base classes of the toolkit are built. For experiment-specific libraries, give the following options to cmake:

* INDRA: to build the libraries needed for analysis of INDRA data, do

    $ cmake S -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=I -DUSE_INDRA=yes
      
* INDRA-VAMOS: to build the libraries needed for analysis of INDRA-VAMOS data, do

    $ cmake S -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=I -DUSE_INDRAVAMOS=yes

* FAZIA: to build the libraries needed for analysis of FAZIA data, do

    $ cmake S -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=I -DUSE_FAZIA=yes

Note that the last two options automatically enable building of the INDRA libraries which are needed by them. To enable building of all optional libraries, you can do:

    $ cmake S -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=I -DUSE_ALL=yes

## 2. Setting paths etc.

To set the paths for executables, shared libraries, man pages, etc., you can execute one of the following scripts in an
neractive shell:

    $ source I/bin/thiskaliveda.csh   [(t)csh shell]
    $ . I/bin/thiskaliveda.sh         [(ba)sh shell]

where I is the installation directory (see 1. above). On (t)csh machines, you will probably need to follow this
with a call to the 'rehash' system function before proceeding. After doing this you should be able to type e.g.:

    $ kaliveda-config
    Usage: kaliveda-config [--version] [--libs] [--incdir] [--libdir] [--bindir] [--help]
    
    $ kaliveda

To setup the KaliVeda paths every time you login to your system, place the call to thiskaliveda.(c)sh
at the end of whatever login script is appropriate for your shell,
a slight modification is required for (t)csh shells:

    source I/bin/thiskaliveda.csh I   [(t)csh shell]
